Karta is a small django app I wrote to keep track of the maps I have.
A database can store information such as the age of the map, its features
(e.g. contour lines, coordinate grid) and, most importantly, the area it covers.
Maps are displayed on an interactive leaflet map so you can pick the a map that
covers your area of interest.

## Dependencies

* Python 3.8
* Django 3.1

It probably works with other versions too but I didn't test that.
